# Foundational

#### A collection of extensions and helpers for the Standard Library and Foundation 

The principle of `Foundational` is to extend Swift and make a beautiful language even more **expressive**. This package contains the only highly reusable code and aims to blur the line between what is a language feature and what is an extension - ie these extensions should be idiomatic and natural to all Swift developers.
